## Technologies Used

- *Frontend*: The frontend of Devhub is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture makes it easy to manage and reuse code.
- *Backend*: The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows us to run JavaScript on the server. Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs.
- *Database*: MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is used for storing data. It stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time.
- *User Authentication*: Devhub uses secure JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to register and login users.

## Features

- *User Authentication*: Users can register and login securely using JWT authentication.
- *Profile Creation*: Users can create a detailed profile including their skills, education, work experience, and a bio.
- *Posts & Discussions*: Users can create posts and comment on other users' posts, facilitating discussion and collaboration.
- *Connect with Developers*: Users can view the profiles of other developers, follow them, and connect with them.
